# Virtual Staging

Virtual Staging is a Python-based project using ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion to generate various interior designs for empty bedrooms. This project allows users to upload an image of an empty bedroom and generate an interior layout automatically.

## Purpose

The main goal of Virtual Staging is to generate interior designs for empty bedroom spaces, offering a virtual staging solution that can be customized to the needs of users.

## Features

- Generate realistic bedroom interiors from an empty bedroom image.
- Utilizes powerful AI tools like Stable Diffusion for image generation.
- Simple to set up and run with minimal manual intervention.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **ComfyUI**
- **Stable Diffusion**

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the project repository to your local environment:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
2. Run `SDVN_WebUI_v3` and make sure to switch the mode to **ComfyUI**.
3. When prompted, upload the `Workflow.py` file to set up the workflow. The system will automatically download any required libraries.
4. Once the environment is ready, a link to the UI will be generated.

## Usage Instructions

1. Upload an image of an empty bedroom.
2. Run the provided workflow.
3. The tool will generate an interior design and display the result.

## Requirements

- **T4 High-RAM system** (suitable for running high-end AI models like Stable Diffusion)
- Python 3.x
- ComfyUI and all necessary libraries (automatically installed during setup)
